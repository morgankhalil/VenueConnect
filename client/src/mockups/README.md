# Tour Detail Page - Tabbed Interface Mockups

These HTML mockups demonstrate the new tabbed interface design for the Tour Detail page, which organizes content into four main tabs:

## Overview Tab
- Tour header with key information
- Stats grid with important metrics
- Quick actions section for common tasks

## Route Planning Tab 
- Interactive map showing venue locations and route
- Timeline view of tour schedule
- Route details with distance, time, and overview information

## Optimization Tab
- Optimization controls and results display
- Before/after comparison of routes
- Detailed statistics on improvements
- AI optimization insights

## Venues Tab
- Complete venue list with filtering controls
- Detailed view of selected venue
- Venue statistics and categorization

## Benefits of the Tabbed Design
1. **Reduced Visual Clutter** - Information is well-organized and focused
2. **Task-Oriented** - Each tab corresponds to a specific workflow
3. **Improved Mobile Experience** - Content is prioritized and fits better on smaller screens
4. **Streamlined Navigation** - Users can quickly switch between different views
5. **Direct Optimization Access** - Optimization panel is integrated directly into the page

## How to Use These Mockups
Open each HTML file in a browser to see the design for each tab:
- `tabbed-tour-ui-mockup.html` - Overview tab
- `route-planning-tab-mockup.html` - Route Planning tab
- `optimization-tab-mockup.html` - Optimization tab
- `venues-tab-mockup.html` - Venues tab

## Implementation Notes
The actual implementation will use React components with the following structure:
- `TourDetailTabs` - Main container component
- Tab content components:
  - `TourOverviewTab`
  - `RoutePlanningTab`
  - `OptimizationTab`
  - `VenuesTab`

The tour timeline will remain a key feature, prominently displayed in the Route Planning tab.
