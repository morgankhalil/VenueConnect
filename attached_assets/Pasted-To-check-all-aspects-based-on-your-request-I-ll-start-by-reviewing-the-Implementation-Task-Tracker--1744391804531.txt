To check all aspects based on your request, Iâ€™ll start by reviewing the Implementation Task Tracker, the EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md, FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, and actual code files. Here's a summary of what to verify:

1. Verify Implementation Task Tracker
Cross-reference each task in the IMPLEMENTATION_TASK_TRACKER.md to confirm its current status in your codebase.
2. Consistency with EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md
Confirm that the strategic goals outlined in your EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md align with active tasks in the tracker and what is implemented in your code.
3. Assess FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
Review each feature in the FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and ensure it matches up with tasks in the tracker.
Detailed Check of Each Phase
Phase 1: Foundation & Core Improvements
Tasks done: Verify that all tasks marked as "Done" in the tracker have corresponding implemented features in your codebase.
In Progress: Check if the tasks marked as "In Progress" show active development in the code.
To Do: Mark the ones that require initiation and confirm their relevance in the execution plan.
Example Verification
Tour Optimization Engine:

All tasks marked "Done", like:
Create database schema for tour routes.
Implement basic routing algorithm.
Each should be reflected accurately in your database and routing code files (e.g., migrations/standardize_venue_statuses.ts, server/routes/tour-routes.ts).
Enhanced Venue Network:

Check if related functionalities exist in the codebase for trust score calculations and venue grouping.
Phase 2: User Experience & Analytics
Tasks under Artist Matching System and Predictive Analytics Dashboard should have clear correlations between the task tracker and implemented features in your code, ensuring development status is accurate.
Final Review
Conduct a final review of custom implementations and functionalities corresponding to what was planned in the tracker and check for discrepancies.
This structured approach will provide clarity on the implementation status and ensure everything aligns with your project goals and documentation. Let me know if you need help with any specific verification or modification!
